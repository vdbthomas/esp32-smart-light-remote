# esp32-smart-light-remote
Using the ESP32 to turn a simple light into a smart light by replicating the infrared remote with an infrared transmitter module.

## How it works
The smart light will be accessible over the web by using the capabilities of the ESP32 to host an asynchronous webserver.

The project will have the front-end contained in a Progressive Web App (PWA) so it can be easily installable on mobile devices using only web development.
